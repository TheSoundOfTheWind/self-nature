Pair of values
This class couples together a pair of values, which may be of different types 
(T1 and T2). The individual values can be accessed through its public members 
first and second.
注意first和second是公有数据成员，可以通过 .first或.second直接访问。

Pairs are a particular case of tuple.

Template parameters
T1
Type of member first, aliased as first_type.
T2
Type of member second, aliased as second_type.
