NAME
unistd.h - standard symbolic constants and types
SYNOPSIS
#include <unistd.h>

DESCRIPTION
The <unistd.h> header defines miscellaneous symbolic constants and types, and declares miscellaneous functions. The actual values of the constants are unspecified except as shown. The contents of this header are shown below.

Version Test Macros
The <unistd.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants. The values shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives.

_POSIX_VERSION
Integer value indicating version of this standard (C-language binding) to which the implementation conforms. For implementations conforming to POSIX.1-2017, the value shall be 200809L.
_POSIX2_VERSION
Integer value indicating version of the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1 to which the implementation conforms. For implementations conforming to POSIX.1-2017, the value shall be 200809L. For profile implementations that define _POSIX_SUBPROFILE (see Subprofiling Considerations) in <unistd.h>, _POSIX2_VERSION may be left undefined or be defined with the value -1 to indicate that the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1 is not supported. In this case, a call to sysconf(_SC_2_VERSION) shall return either 200809L or -1 indicating that the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1 is or is not, respectively, supported at runtime.
The <unistd.h> header shall define the following symbolic constant only if the implementation supports the XSI option; see XSI Conformance. If defined, its value shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives.

_XOPEN_VERSION
[XSI] [Option Start]
Integer value indicating version of the X/Open Portability Guide to which the implementation conforms. The value shall be 700. [Option End]
Constants for Options and Option Groups
The following symbolic constants, if defined in <unistd.h>, shall have a value of -1, 0, or greater, unless otherwise specified below. For profile implementations that define _POSIX_SUBPROFILE (see Subprofiling Considerations) in <unistd.h>, constants described below as always having a value greater than zero need not be defined and, if defined, may have a value of -1, 0, or greater. The values shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives.

If a symbolic constant is not defined or is defined with the value -1, the option is not supported for compilation. If it is defined with a value greater than zero, the option shall always be supported when the application is executed. If it is defined with the value zero, the option shall be supported for compilation and might or might not be supported at runtime. See Options for further information about the conformance requirements of these three categories of support.

APPLICATION USAGE
POSIX.1-2017 only describes the behavior of systems that claim conformance to it. However, application developers who want to write applications that adapt to other versions of this standard (or to systems that do not conform to any POSIX standard) may find it useful to code them so as to conditionally compile different code depending on the value of _POSIX_VERSION, for example:

#if _POSIX_VERSION >= 200112L
/* Use the newer function that copes with large files. */
off_t pos=ftello(fp);
#else
/* Either this is an old version of POSIX, or _POSIX_VERSION is
   not even defined, so use the traditional function. */
long pos=ftell(fp);
#endif

Earlier versions of POSIX.1-2017 and of the Single UNIX Specification can be identified by the following macros:

POSIX.1-1988 standard
_POSIX_VERSION==198808L
POSIX.1-1990 standard
_POSIX_VERSION==199009L
ISO POSIX-1:1996 standard
_POSIX_VERSION==199506L
Single UNIX Specification, Version 1
_XOPEN_UNIX and _XOPEN_VERSION==4
Single UNIX Specification, Version 2
_XOPEN_UNIX and _XOPEN_VERSION==500
ISO POSIX-1:2001 and Single UNIX Specification, Version 3
_POSIX_VERSION==200112L, plus (if the XSI option is supported) _XOPEN_UNIX and _XOPEN_VERSION==600
POSIX.1-2017 does not make any attempt to define application binary interaction with the underlying operating system. However, application developers may find it useful to query _SC_VERSION at runtime via sysconf() to determine whether the current version of the operating system supports the necessary functionality as in the following program fragment:

if (sysconf(_SC_VERSION) < 200809L) {
    fprintf(stderr, "POSIX.1-2008 system required, terminating \n");
    exit(1);
}

New applications should not use _XOPEN_SHM or _XOPEN_ENH_I18N.

RATIONALE
As POSIX.1-2017 evolved, certain options became sufficiently standardized that it was concluded that simply requiring one of the option choices was simpler than retaining the option. However, for backwards-compatibility, the option flags (with required constant values) are retained.

Version Test Macros
The standard developers considered altering the definition of _POSIX_VERSION and removing _SC_VERSION from the specification of sysconf() since the utility to an application was deemed by some to be minimal, and since the implementation of the functionality is potentially problematic. However, they recognized that support for existing application binaries is a concern to manufacturers, application developers, and the users of implementations conforming to POSIX.1-2017.

While the example using _SC_VERSION in the APPLICATION USAGE section does not provide the greatest degree of imaginable utility to the application developer or user, it is arguably better than a core file or some other equally obscure result. (It is also possible for implementations to encode and recognize application binaries compiled in various POSIX.1-conforming environments, and modify the semantics of the underlying system to conform to the expectations of the application.) For the reasons outlined in the preceding paragraphs and in the APPLICATION USAGE section, the standard developers elected to retain the _POSIX_VERSION and _SC_VERSION functionality.

Compile-Time Symbolic Constants for System-Wide Options
POSIX.1-2017 includes support in certain areas for the newly adopted policy governing options and stubs.

This policy provides flexibility for implementations in how they support options. It also specifies how conforming applications can adapt to different implementations that support different sets of options. It allows the following:

If an implementation has no interest in supporting an option, it does not have to provide anything associated with that option beyond the announcement that it does not support it.

An implementation can support a partial or incompatible version of an option (as a non-standard extension) as long as it does not claim to support the option.

An application can determine whether the option is supported. A strictly conforming application must check this announcement mechanism before first using anything associated with the option.

There is an important implication of this policy. POSIX.1-2017 cannot dictate the behavior of interfaces associated with an option when the implementation does not claim to support the option. In particular, it cannot require that a function associated with an unsupported option will fail if it does not perform as specified. However, this policy does not prevent a standard from requiring certain functions to always be present, but that they shall always fail on some implementations. The setpgid() function in the POSIX.1-1990 standard, for example, is considered appropriate.

The POSIX standards include various options, and the C-language binding support for an option implies that the implementation must supply data types and function interfaces. An application must be able to discover whether the implementation supports each option.

Any application must consider the following three cases for each option:

Option never supported.

The implementation advertises at compile time that the option will never be supported. In this case, it is not necessary for the implementation to supply any of the data types or function interfaces that are provided only as part of the option. The implementation might provide data types and functions that are similar to those defined by POSIX.1-2017, but there is no guarantee for any particular behavior.

Option always supported.

The implementation advertises at compile time that the option will always be supported. In this case, all data types and function interfaces shall be available and shall operate as specified.

Option might or might not be supported.

Some implementations might not provide a mechanism to specify support of options at compile time. In addition, the implementation might be unable or unwilling to specify support or non-support at compile time. In either case, any application that might use the option at runtime must be able to compile and execute. The implementation must provide, at compile time, all data types and function interfaces that are necessary to allow this. In this situation, there must be a mechanism that allows the application to query, at runtime, whether the option is supported. If the application attempts to use the option when it is not supported, the result is unspecified unless explicitly specified otherwise in POSIX.1-2017.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.

CHANGE HISTORY
First released in Issue 1. Derived from Issue 1 of the SVID.

Issue 5
The DESCRIPTION is updated for alignment with the POSIX Realtime Extension and the POSIX Threads Extension.

The symbolic constants _XOPEN_REALTIME and _XOPEN_REALTIME_THREADS are added. _POSIX2_C_BIND, _XOPEN_ENH_I18N, and _XOPEN_SHM must now be set to a value other than -1 by a conforming implementation.

Large File System extensions are added.

The type of the argument to sbrk() is changed from int to intptr_t.

_XBS_ constants are added to the list of constants for Options and Option Groups, to the list of constants for the confstr() function, and to the list of constants to the sysconf() function. These are all marked EX.

Issue 6
_POSIX2_C_VERSION is removed.

The Open Group Corrigendum U026/4 is applied, adding the prototype for fdatasync().

The Open Group Corrigendum U026/1 is applied, adding the symbols _SC_XOPEN_LEGACY, _SC_XOPEN_REALTIME, and _SC_XOPEN_REALTIME_THREADS.

The symbols _XOPEN_STREAMS and _SC_XOPEN_STREAMS are added to support the XSI STREAMS Option Group.

Text in the DESCRIPTION relating to conformance requirements is moved elsewhere in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

The LEGACY symbol _SC_PASS_MAX is removed.

The following new requirements on POSIX implementations derive from alignment with the Single UNIX Specification:

The _CS_POSIX_* and _CS_XBS5_* constants are added for the confstr() function.

The _SC_XBS5_* constants are added for the sysconf() function.

The symbolic constants F_ULOCK, F_LOCK, F_TLOCK, and F_TEST are added.

The uid_t, gid_t, off_t, pid_t, and useconds_t types are mandated.

The gethostname() prototype is added for sockets.

A new section is added for System-Wide Options.

Function prototypes for setegid() and seteuid() are added.

Option symbolic constants are added for _POSIX_ADVISORY_INFO, _POSIX_CPUTIME, _POSIX_SPAWN, _POSIX_SPORADIC_SERVER, _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME, _POSIX_THREAD_SPORADIC_SERVER, and _POSIX_TIMEOUTS, and pathconf() variables are added for _PC_ALLOC_SIZE_MIN, _PC_REC_INCR_XFER_SIZE, _PC_REC_MAX_XFER_SIZE, _PC_REC_MIN_XFER_SIZE, and _PC_REC_XFER_ALIGN for alignment with IEEE Std 1003.1d-1999.

The following are added for alignment with IEEE Std 1003.1j-2000:

Option symbolic constants _POSIX_BARRIERS, _POSIX_CLOCK_SELECTION, _POSIX_MONOTONIC_CLOCK, _POSIX_READER_WRITER_LOCKS, _POSIX_SPIN_LOCKS, and _POSIX_TYPED_MEMORY_OBJECTS

sysconf() variables _SC_BARRIERS, _SC_CLOCK_SELECTION, _SC_MONOTONIC_CLOCK, _SC_READER_WRITER_LOCKS, _SC_SPIN_LOCKS, and _SC_TYPED_MEMORY_OBJECTS

The _SC_XBS5 macros associated with the ISO/IEC 9899:1990 standard are marked LEGACY, and new equivalent _SC_V6 macros associated with the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard are introduced.

The getwd() function is marked LEGACY.

The restrict keyword is added to the prototypes for readlink() and swab().

Constants for options are now harmonized, so when supported they take the year of approval of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 as the value.

The following are added for alignment with IEEE Std 1003.1q-2000:

Optional symbolic constants _POSIX_TRACE, _POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_FILTER, _POSIX_TRACE_LOG, and _POSIX_TRACE_INHERIT

The sysconf() symbolic constants _SC_TRACE, _SC_TRACE_EVENT_FILTER, _SC_TRACE_LOG, and _SC_TRACE_INHERIT
